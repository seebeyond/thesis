\chapter{Preface}

This thesis was prepared at the department of Informatics and Mathematical Modeling at the Technical University of Denmark in fulfillment of the requirements for acquiring a M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering.

The thesis deals with the problem of opinion spam - deceptive reviews posted on review websites by dishonest users trying to promote or demote certain products and sellers.

The thesis consists of an introduction to the problem of opinion spam and the current state-of-the-art research models that deal with it. The following chapters propose, describe and discuss the methods used to design a complete solution to detect opinion spam using semantic similarity, as well as a detection method based on recent research models aimed at extracting product aspects from short texts, using topic modeling and in particular Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
