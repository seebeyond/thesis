\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I thank my supervisor Paul Pop for his support and guidance not only while writing this thesis, but also during several courses I took while being a student at Technical University of Denmark. 

I am grateful to my advisor Martin Ester, Professor at Simon Fraser University for his insightful advices during this last year. He has helped me narrow down my research problem and provided knowledgeable feedback step by step as I was developing the models.

I thank my colleagues Stine Mangor Tornmark and Jan BÃ¼low at Trustpilot for granting my request to build and use a dataset for my research.
